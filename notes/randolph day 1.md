### question for IAN:
 portrait mounting: velcro? note that when pulling it off the wall it can't disturb the webcam's mounting (and possibly the raspberry pi + connections if also mounted on the wall)

- no longer calling it the 'interview room', it's now the 'creation space' 

### question for SYDNEY: lighting in the creation space?

### question for group: legal! 


### question for the group: how much of the tech do we want exposed. 
  - tech can/will break. so many nodes in the piece. 

### Ian to me: 4-point speaker system that has art history podcast broadcasting in the waiting room. audio of artist biographies. 
  - speaker 1 near the entrance to waiting room: the unprocessed audio of the source material (art history podcasts, lectures, artist biographies, etc. )
  - speaker 2 somewhere between speaker 1 and the exit of WR heading to the creation space: speech2text of source material > text2speech
  - speaker 3 & 4 (maybe): each repeating the process of speaker 2. 
  - conceits: artist doesn't always see their work published before the curator does (a comment on authority/authorship, control of one's vision/voice...) && also consider that this can condition the audience not to expect perfect translation of their own interview.
