OSX: you will use the application "Terminal.app". This is found either in Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app, or you use the shortcut Command+Space, and type terminal and hit enter. Do this now. 

in terminal copy the following text and hit enter:

```shell
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
Might take a while. This command installs something called 'homebrew', which is like a free marketplace for programs which run within Terminal.app. 
When its completed, type this and hit enter:

```shell
brew install sox
```
Homebrew will install an audio manipulation program called *sox*. 


Windows: 

1. Install pkg manager (chocolatey?)
2. Install [sox](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/files/latest/download)
