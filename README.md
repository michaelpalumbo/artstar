**Our artstar interviewer program is written in javascript & nodejs.**

## Install instructions for OSX: 
1. Run the program *Terminal.app*
  - This is found either in Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app, or you use the shortcut Command+Space, and type terminal and hit enter. Do this now. 

2. Copy the following text, paste it in a terminal window, and hit enter:

```shell
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
Might take a while. This command installs something called 'homebrew', which is like a free marketplace for programs which run within Terminal.app. 

3. When its completed, type this and hit enter:

```shell
brew install sox
```
Homebrew will install an audio manipulation program called *sox*. 
4. Install nodejs
```shell
brew install node
```
5. Install imagesnap
```shell
brew install imagesnap
```

Windows: 

1. Install [sox](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/files/latest/download)
2. Install [nodejs](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/windows/node-windows.html)
  - note: in the 'Test It!' section, they refer to something called a 'command line tool', like Powershell or Windows Command Prompt. You should be able to find either of these in your programs folder. 
  - For now, you can ignore their suggestion of "Create a test file and run it" (unless you're comfortable or curious about programming in nodejs)
